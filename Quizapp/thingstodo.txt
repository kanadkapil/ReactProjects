Implementation: Add an explanation field to each question in the data.js file and display it after the user answers a question.

Implementation: After the quiz ends, provide a review page where users can click through each question and see the result.

8. Leaderboard Integration (Firebase or Backend):
Description: If you're interested in saving user scores across sessions or implementing a competitive leaderboard, you can integrate a backend (like Firebase or any other API) to store and display user scores.

Implementation: Integrate Firebase, set up Firestore for storing scores, and allow users to submit their results to the database.

9. User Authentication:
Description: Allow users to create accounts or log in to track their quiz history, scores, and progress over time.

Implementation: Integrate a simple authentication system (e.g., Firebase Authentication) and store user data securely.

10. Customizable Question Sets:

Implementation: Track the user's performance and increase or decrease the question difficulty dynamically.

14. Review & Feedback System:
Description: Allow users to give feedback on questions after completing the quiz (e.g., if a question was unclear or incorrect).

Implementation: Provide a form or modal after the quiz where users can submit feedback, and store the feedback in a backend or local storage.

15. Mobile-Friendly / Responsiveness:
Description: Make the quiz fully responsive and mobile-friendly for an optimal user experience on any device.

Implementation: Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens and ensure the buttons and text are appropriately sized on mobile.

16. Accessibility Improvements:
Description: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., adding screen reader support and keyboard navigation).

Implementation: Add ARIA attributes, ensure color contrast for readability, and allow full keyboard navigation.

17. Quiz Sharing:
Description: Allow users to share their quiz results on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) or through a shareable link.

Implementation: Add share buttons with the help of the appropriate social media APIs or a service like react-share.
